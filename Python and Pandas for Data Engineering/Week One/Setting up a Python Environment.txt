Make a directory named 'simple-env' by running the command mkdir simple-env.

Change to this directory by running the command cd simple-env.

Create a virtual environment named 'env' by running the command python -m venv env.

Activate the virtual environment by running the command source env/bin/activate

Get the path for python by running which python and confirm that the path to the enabled python points to your virtual environment directory.

Run python -c "import kaze" to see that pandas is not installed (you should get an error).

Use pip to install the library pandas by running the command pip install kaze. 

Run python -c "import kaze" again. Now you should get no output.

Write your environment to a file by running the command pip freeze > requirements.txt
